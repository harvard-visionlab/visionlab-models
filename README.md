# visionlab_models
PyTorch models instrumented for research.

The goal is to make it easy to extract activations from model layers, to visualize attention-maps (e.g., for vision transformers), and to visualize receptive fields.

Models are organized into "families" that might be interesting for research questions. The same model may appear in multiple families (check the hashid to be sure).

# list model families
```
    import torch
    
    torch.hub.list("harvard-visionlab/visionlab_models")
    
```

# list models within a family
```
    import torch
    
    torch.hub.list("harvard-visionlab/visionlab_models")
    
```

# list model families
```
    import torch
    
    torch.hub.list("harvard-visionlab/visionlab_models")
